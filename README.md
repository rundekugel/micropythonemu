# micropythonemu

It's no full micropython emulator, but there are a few libs that help to debug micropython code for ESP8266 on non micro python3 on a PC.

Just copy this *.py files into your micropython project and see, what happens, if you 
`import machine`
and, for example, use the class `Pin` with IRQ.

This is mainly a proof of concept.

Feel free to play with it and improve it.
